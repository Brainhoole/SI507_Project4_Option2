I have already changed a pingpong game to a bricks breaker game.

**A New game feature**
I define a new class called `Brick_Lastline` subclass of `BallDeflector` and switch last line of bricks to be instances of `Brick_Lastline` instead of `Brick`. And I change the color of these bricks. When the ball hits these special bricks, the velocity of the ball will decrease 0.5 pixels per game circle.
